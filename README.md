</div>

`webpty` keeps the terminal dominant: the shell owns almost the whole screen,
sessions live in a narrow rail on the right, and a WT-compatible settings file
drives profiles, themes, and keyboard shortcuts. The shipped CLI is a single
Rust binary: `webpty up` starts the embedded web UI and the PTY runtime
together.

The app is intentionally smaller than Windows Terminal, but it now runs a real
Rust PTY backend instead of a mock transcript transport. Startup lands directly
in the shell prompt, and non-Windows fallbacks preserve profile-shaped prompts
instead of collapsing to `bash-5.2$`.

Settings resolution order is:

1. `webpty up --settings <path>` or `WEBPTY_SETTINGS_PATH=<path>`
2. `./config/webpty.settings.json` from the current working directory, if present
3. the user-scoped platform path

The repository sample at `config/webpty.settings.json` is still useful for
development, screenshots, and a known-good flat theme baseline.

## Current Status

Implemented today:

- live PTY-backed sessions from a Rust/Axum server
- embedded production web UI served directly by the Rust binary
- `webpty up` CLI entrypoint for local startup
- `webpty up --funnel` external access through Tailscale Funnel
- one dominant black terminal surface with a narrow white right-side session rail and no top toolbar
- a single-split pane workspace inside the active tab
- no injected startup banner ahead of the shell prompt
- WT-compatible `settings.json` loading, normalization, persistence, and unknown-key round-trip preservation
- profile launch, default profile selection, theme switching, and JSON editing in a Windows 11-style right-anchored settings panel
- profile-matched fallback prompts on non-Windows hosts so Windows-targeted profiles do not collapse to `bash-5.2$`
- WebSocket input/output streaming and PTY resize handling

Not implemented yet:

- deeper pane graphs, drag rearranging, and persisted pane layouts
- command palette and search surface
- drag/drop or manual tab reordering
- deeper Windows Terminal action object parity
- full asset/icon parity for every Windows Terminal profile icon URI format
- session restoration across app restarts

## Product Direction

The reference project is [microsoft/terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

The goal is not line-by-line parity. The goal is:

- a shell that feels like a terminal application first
- compatibility with the useful Windows Terminal settings subset
- a Rust runtime that owns PTY lifecycle, input, resize, and streaming
- restrained chrome with no persistent top toolbar and a cleaner browser footprint than a dashboard-style UI

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Rust 1.94+
- Node.js 24+ and npm 11+ only if you are rebuilding the frontend bundle or working on the UI

### Global install

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/smturtle2/webpty --bin webpty --locked
```

From a local checkout you can also install the binary directly:

```bash
cargo install --path apps/server --bin webpty --locked
```

### Run

```bash
webpty up
```

For the repository sample settings and screenshots:

```bash
webpty up --settings ./config/webpty.settings.json
```

### Run with external access

```bash
webpty up --funnel
```

`--funnel` uses the local `tailscale` CLI to publish the embedded web UI over
Tailscale Funnel. Run `tailscale up` first and make sure the node has Funnel
capability enabled.

### Settings Path

Resolution order:

- `webpty up --settings <path>`
- `WEBPTY_SETTINGS_PATH=<path>`
- `./config/webpty.settings.json` in the current working directory, if present
- user-scoped platform path

User-scoped platform path:

- Linux/macOS: `~/.config/webpty/settings.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\webpty\\settings.json`

### Development

Install workspace dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend dev server:

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

Run the Rust runtime:

```bash
cargo run -- up
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` requests to `http://127.0.0.1:3001`,
while production builds are emitted into `apps/server/ui` and served by the Rust
binary.

## Validate

```bash
npm run build:web
cargo test --manifest-path apps/server/Cargo.toml
cargo check
```

`npm run lint:web` is still configured, but it still hangs in this workspace and
needs separate investigation.

## Roadmap

- [x] Replace mock transport with a PTY-backed session layer
- [x] Move to a terminal-dominant layout with a right-side session rail

- [ ] Reintroduce search and command palette surfaces
- [ ] Expand WT settings and action compatibility
